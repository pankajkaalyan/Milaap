# Customer Guide

Follow these sections in order to understand the complete user experience.

## 1. Registration

**Navigation Path**: `/register` (Just click "Sign Up" button on homepage)

### What is Registration?

Registration is how you create an account on Milaap. Think of it as:
- **Registration = Your Login Account** (email + password)
- **Profile = Your Matrimony Profile** (your photos, bio, preferences)

You need to register first, activate your email, then the admin approves you, and then you can create your full matrimonial profile.

### Step-by-Step Registration Instructions

#### Step 1: Find the Registration Page

1. Open Milaap website on your browser
2. Look at the top of the homepage
3. You'll see buttons like "Log In" or "Sign Up"
4. Click on **"Sign Up"** or **"Register"**
5. You'll see a form titled "Create Account" or "Register"

#### Step 2: Fill in Your Email Address

1. Look for the field labeled **"Email Address"** or **"Email"**
2. Click on the text box (it will turn blue/highlighted)
3. Type your email address carefully
   - Examples: yourname@gmail.com, raj.sharma@yahoo.com
   - Make sure there are no spaces or typos
   - Use an email address you check regularly—you'll receive important notifications here
4. The system will check if this email is already registered
   - If yes, you'll see a red error message: "This email is already in use. Please use a different email or log in."
   - If no, you can proceed

**Why your email matters:**
- This is how you log in (instead of a username)
- You'll receive approval/rejection emails here
- Password reset links go here
- Important notifications about matches are sent here

#### Step 3: Create a Strong Password

1. Find the **"Password"** field
2. Click on it to start typing
3. Create a password that:
   - Is at least 8 characters long (12+ is better)
   - Has uppercase letters (A, B, C)
   - Has lowercase letters (a, b, c)
   - Has numbers (0-9)
   - Has symbols (!@#$%)
   - Examples: MyPassword123! or Raj@2024Love

4. **Password Requirements:**
   - ✅ MyPassword123! (Good—has all requirements)
   - ❌ password (Bad—too simple, no numbers or symbols)
   - ❌ 12345678 (Bad—only numbers)
   - ❌ Pass123 (Bad—too short, only 7 characters)

**Why a strong password matters:**
- Keeps your account secure
- Prevents hackers from accessing your profile
- Protects your personal information

#### Step 4: Confirm Your Password

1. Find the **"Confirm Password"** field
2. Type the same password you just entered in Step 3
3. This confirms you typed it correctly
4. If passwords don't match, you'll see error: "Passwords do not match"

#### Step 5: Enter Your Full Name

1. Find the **"Full Name"** field
2. Type your complete name as you'd like it to appear on your profile
   - Example: Raj Kumar Sharma
   - Example: Priya Patel
3. Use your real name—Milaap has a verification process to ensure authenticity

**Note:** This is the name that will appear on your matrimonial profile, so other members will see it.

#### Step 6: Select Your Gender

1. Find the **"Gender"** dropdown menu
2. Click on it (it will expand to show options)
3. Select one option:
   - **Male**
   - **Female**
   - **Other** (if available)
4. This helps the system suggest compatible matches

**Why gender matters:**
- If you're male, the system will suggest female matches (unless you prefer otherwise)
- If you're female, the system will suggest male matches (unless you prefer otherwise)

#### Step 7: Enter Your Date of Birth

1. Find the **"Date of Birth"** or **"DOB"** field
2. Click on the calendar icon (📅) next to it
3. A date picker will appear
4. Select your birth month from the top dropdown
5. Select your birth year from the left/right arrows
6. Click on your birth date
7. The format should look like: "25-Jan-1990" or "1990-01-25"

**Important Rules:**
- You must be at least **18 years old**
- If you're under 18, you'll see error: "You must be 18 or older to register"
- Never lie about your age—the system checks against photo verification later

**Why date of birth matters:**
- Required by law for matrimony websites
- Used to calculate your age (which appears on your profile)
- Used for horoscope compatibility matching
- Age verification is part of the approval process

#### Step 8: Review Everything Before Submitting

Before you click "Register", check:

```
✅ Email: Is it spelled correctly?
✅ Email: Can you access this email account?
✅ Password: Did you write it down somewhere safe?
✅ Name: Is it spelled correctly?
✅ Gender: Is it correct?
✅ DOB: Is it your real date of birth?
✅ All fields: Are all required fields filled (marked with *)?
```

#### Step 9: Click "Register" or "Create Account"

1. Look for the blue button that says **"Register"** or **"Create Account"**
2. Click on it
3. Wait for the page to process (usually 2-5 seconds)

#### Step 10: What Happens Next

You'll see a confirmation message:

> "Registration Successful! Please check your email to verify your account."

or

> "Check your email within the next 5 minutes for your verification link."

**Important:** This message means:
- ✅ Your account has been created
- ⏳ You need to verify your email
- 📧 An email is being sent to you right now

### Verifying Your Email Address

#### Step 1: Check Your Email

1. Open your email account (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.)
2. Look for an email from **"Milaap"** or **"noreply@milaap.com"**
3. The subject line might be:
   - "Verify Your Email"
   - "Activate Your Account"
   - "Welcome to Milaap - Verify Your Email"
4. **Don't see it?** Check these folders:
   - **Spam folder** - Sometimes emails go here by mistake
   - **Promotions folder** - In Gmail, this is a separate tab
   - **Other folders** - If you have custom filters

**If you still don't see the email after 10 minutes:**
- Go back to Milaap login page
- Look for link that says "Didn't receive activation email? Resend"
- Click it to send the email again

#### Step 2: Open the Email from Milaap

1. Find and click on the Milaap email
2. Read the content
3. You'll see a button that says:
   - **"Verify Email"** or
   - **"Activate Account"** or
   - **"Confirm Email"**

#### Step 3: Click the Verification Link

**Option A: Using the Button**
1. Click the blue button in the email
2. You'll be taken to the Milaap website
3. You'll see message: "Email verified successfully!"

**Option B: Using the Link**
1. If there's a long link in the email instead of a button
2. Copy and paste it into your browser's address bar

4. You'll see: "Email verified successfully!"

#### Step 4: What Happens After Email Verification

After clicking the verification link, your account is now:

```
Status: ✅ EMAIL VERIFIED
Status: ⏳ PENDING ADMIN APPROVAL
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ Your email address is confirmed as real
- ⏳ Your profile has been submitted to Milaap admins for review
- ⏳ An admin team member will manually check your profile
- ⏳ You CANNOT use the full website until approved
- ⏳ Approval takes **24-48 hours** (usually faster)

### Understanding the Admin Approval Process

#### Why Do We Need Admin Approval?

Milaap's admin team reviews every new profile to:

1. **Prevent Fake Profiles**
   - Ensure you're a real person
   - Check that you're not using someone else's photos
   - Verify you're not a scammer

2. **Ensure Safety**
   - Protect members from inappropriate content
   - Remove profiles that violate guidelines
   - Keep the community safe

3. **Verify Your Age**
   - Check you're at least 18 years old
   - Prevent underage registrations
   - Match government ID requirements

4. **Check Community Guidelines**
   - Your photos are appropriate
   - Your bio doesn't contain inappropriate content
   - You're not advertising or selling anything

#### What the Admin Checks

When the admin reviews your profile, they look at:

| Item | What They Check |
|------|-----------------|
| **Email** | Is it a real, active email? |
| **Name** | Does it match the profile? |
| **Age** | Are you at least 18 years old? |
| **Profile Photo** | Is it clear, recent, and of your face? |
| **Profile Info** | Is all information filled and genuine? |
| **Bio/Description** | Is it appropriate and genuine? |
| **Verification** | Do you have verification documents? |

#### Possible Outcomes

- ❌ Too strict = very few results
- ✅ 5-10 results is good starting point
- ✅ Update filters to try different combinations

#### Step 4: Apply Filters

2. Click it

  - Profile photo
  - Name, age, location

  - "Express Interest" button

**Example Result:**
```

### Understanding Search Results

#### Search Results Count

- **0 results**: No one matches your criteria
  - Solution: Broaden your filters
  - Expand age range
  - Add more cities
  - Add more religions/castes

- **1-5 results**: Very specific criteria
  - Solution: Maybe widen filters slightly
  - Or keep criteria and check results regularly (new people join daily)

- **5-20 results**: Good number
  - Manageable to browse
  - People match your preferences well

- **20-50 results**: Larger pool
  - More options
  - May need to narrow down

- **50+ results**: Very broad criteria
  - Can see top matches first (sorted by compatibility)
  - Can narrow filters to reduce

#### Match Percentage

What it shows:
- How well profile matches YOUR preferences
- Based on age, location, religion, caste, etc.
- NOT based on how likely they'll like you back

**Interpretation:**
- 95-100%: Perfect match for your criteria
- 80-94%: Excellent match
- 70-79%: Good match
- 60-69%: Acceptable match
- Below 60%: Doesn't match preferences well (but might still be worth checking!)

**Important Note:**
- High match % doesn't guarantee chemistry
- Low match % doesn't mean incompatibility
- Check profiles regardless of %
- Sometimes best connections are unexpected!

### Search Tips and Tricks

1. **Start Broad**
   - Don't apply too many filters initially
   - See what's available
   - Then refine

2. **Update Regularly**
   - New users join every day
   - Re-run searches weekly
   - You might find new people

3. **Check Recently Updated**
   - Recently updated profiles rank higher
   - More likely to respond
   - More active users

4. **Use Multiple Searches**
   - Save multiple search criteria
   - "Young professionals in Mumbai"
   - "Engineers across India"
   - "Specific caste in specific cities"

5. **Expand Your Criteria**
   - Don't be too strict on every filter
   - Flexibility increases chances
   - Don't compromise core values
   - But be open to surprises

6. **Review Rejected Searches**
   - Search for profiles you previously rejected
   - People grow and change
   - Preferences might change too
   - Worth revisiting

### Save and Unsave Searches

**Some websites allow saved searches:**
- Save your current filter combination
- Search name: "Engineering professionals in tech cities"
- Run same search anytime with one click
- Get notified of new matches for this search

### Common Search Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why it's a problem | Solution |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Age range: 25-26 only | Too restrictive | Expand to 24-28 |
| Only 1 city | Too narrow | Add 3-5 cities |
| All filters filled strictly | Very few results | Leave some blank |
| Income filter too high | Eliminates good people | Focus on character not money |
| Never updating search | Missing new great people | Run weekly |
| Only sorting by match % | Might miss great connections | Also browse other results |
| Too picky on appearance | Real connections matter more | Look beyond photos |
